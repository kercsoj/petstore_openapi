                "description": "This is an asynchronous operation. Calling this endpoint will start a new job and return immediately with status information.\nHowever, the operation will continue running on the server. The caller can poll the status of the job to find out when it is\nready.\n\nIf a job with the same query parameters already exists, its details are returned rather than starting a new job.\n\nIf no scope is specified, then the endpoint uses the default scope of the authenticated user.\nReturns an error if the user has access to several scopes and the scope is not explicitly specified.\n\nFor incremental queries, the output uses a special metadata field called `action` to identify whether a record is *upserted*\n(inserted or updated) or *(hard) deleted* (`U` corresponds to upsert, and `D` to delete):\n```json\n{ \"meta\": { \"action\": \"U\", ... }, \"key\": { \"pkey\": 1 }, \"value\": { \"prop1\": \"value1\", \"prop2\": 42 } }\n{ \"meta\": { \"action\": \"U\", ... }, \"key\": { \"pkey\": 2 }, \"value\": { \"prop1\": \"value2\", \"prop2\": null } }\n{ \"meta\": { \"action\": \"D\", ... }, \"key\": { \"pkey\": 3 } }\n```\nUpserted records have the primary key fields present in the sub-object `key` and all other data fields in the sub-object `value`.\nDeleted records only have the primary key fields in the `key` property, and lack the `value` property.\n\nHard deletes are infrequent. They only take place when a record is irreversibly deleted from the source database, e.g. to comply\nwith privacy or legal requirements.\n\nIn most cases, records are *soft-deleted*, i.e. they are updated in such a way as to be understood *deleted* or *inactive* though\nthe record is retained in the database, e.g. by setting a `workflow_state` column to the value `inactive` or `deleted`. In this\ncontext, soft deletes are equivalent to an update, and are denoted with a `U`, and all field values are included in the output.\n\nIn the rare event that inserting a record is quickly followed by a hard delete in the source database between two successive\nincremental queries, a record might appear with a new (so far unseen) `key`, no `value` and an `action` of `D`.\n\nFor snapshot queries, deleted records are not included in the output:\n```json\n{ \"meta\": { ... }, \"key\": { \"pkey\": 1 }, \"value\": { \"prop1\": \"value1\", \"prop2\": 42 } }\n{ \"meta\": { ... }, \"key\": { \"pkey\": 2 }, \"value\": { \"prop1\": \"value2\", \"prop2\": null } }\n```\n\nThis is a rate-limited endpoint. If excessive data volume is requested repeatedly using this endpoint (e.g. a full snapshot every\nhour), future requests may be denied. We encourage making use of incremental queries, which substantially reduce the amount of data\nreturned.",

For example, assume we have the following CSV output:\n```csv\nmeta.action,key.pkey,value.prop1,value.prop2\nU,1,\"value1\",42\nU,2,\"value2\",\nD,3,,\n```\nThen the schema would read the same as in the JSON example above.\n\nNested JSON objects are flattened to simple fields, with composite names constructed using the dot notation (`parent.child`).\n\nIf no scope is specified, then the endpoint uses the default scope of the authenticated user.\nReturns an error if the user has access to several scopes and the scope is not explicitly specified.",
